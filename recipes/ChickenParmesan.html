  <ol>
    <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>

      level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
    <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; sprinkle flour over chicken breasts,

        <li>Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides.</li>
        <li>Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes. </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the
      hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. </li>
    <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish.
      <ol>
        <li>Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the
      center, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
